**Abstract**

In many online networks, nodes are partitioned into categories (e.g., countries or universities in OSNs), which naturally defines a weighted category graph i.e., a coarse-grained version of the underlying network. In this paper, we show how to efficiently estimate the category graph from a probability sample of nodes. We prove consistency of our estimators and evaluate their efficiency via simulation. We also apply our methodology to a sample of Facebook users to obtain a number of category graphs, such as the college friendship graph and the country friendship graph.
