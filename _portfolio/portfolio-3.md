My work in this set of projects is focused on understanding social networks in the context of social movements and governmental action in the climate change and environmental action space.

## Environmental Governance

<b>Organizational Decision-making in the face of climate change:</b> [Dr. Benjamin Bagozzi](https://www.benjaminbagozzi.com/), and I am engaged in creating several large-scale dynamic networks with direct application to governmental policy and decision-making regarding climate change. International climate change negotiations often are undertaken at an annual Conference of the Parties (COPs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC’s 21st COP (held in late November 2015) served as a watershed moment, given its mandate to achieve a legally binding universal agreement on climate change among all the world's nations. We have conducted an original analysis of the country-level relations network underlying these international climate change negotiations through text and network methods.

## Environmental Action

<b>Radical Environmental Groups:</b> Radical environmental activists, in their efforts to call attention to environmental problems, to communicate with like-minded groups, and to mobilize support for their activities, produce an enormous amount of text. Access to this information leads to an intriguing set of questions: can one uncover the underlying network structure of even covert environmental activist groups from their publications? And, if so, can one also identify which groups and sub-networks are more prone to certain impactful behaviors (e.g., violent versus peaceful protest activities)? We have published two papers on the Do or Die! Movement in the UK through combined text, network, and spatial analysis methods. We then followed up with a comparative case in the US, where we looked into the texts produced by the Animal Liberation Front movement.

## Disaster Response

**Evacuation and Displacement Due to Climate Change and Disasters:** I have been engaged in modeling the network dynamics of organizational decision-making during disasters, with a focus on hurricanes and fires. Recently, in collaboration with Facebook Data for Good (JW Schneider (Demography and Survey Science, Facebook) and Paige Maas (Core Data Science, Facebook)), we surveyed displaced and evacuated individuals post-natural disasters. We have so far surveyed after Floods in India and Bushfires in Australia. The first paper on this is available on Arxiv (Maas et al., 2020) and is currently under review. It is the basis for Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) estimates on displacement. Future work aims to establish a rapid response survey to build an extensive database of surveys post-disaster response, focusing on evacuation and social and economic impact.
