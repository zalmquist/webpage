My research in Social Networks/Network Science methods builds on concepts and techniques developed for studying social networks. Networks offer a powerful and compelling framework for understanding fundamental relations, whether the relations driving an individual’s life and success (e.g., advice, friendship) or the relations governing large organizations that influence our society (e.g., communications between FEMA and local governments). While these tools are powerful in their unique combination of generalizability and precision in measuring our social world, too often, they are limited in the contextual information they include. For example, network researchers have historically modeled network data using only formal features of the network, such as the size of an individual’s friend group, while ignoring other important characteristics such as how often the friends interact (time), and how closely they live to each other (space). This limited use of contextual information is a major failing of much of the social network literature, which overlooks our environment's enormous impact on our behavior. By addressing contextual mechanisms through the powerful social network lens, we can improve our understanding of social processes and our ability to predict social action - this is the central theme of my research agenda.
