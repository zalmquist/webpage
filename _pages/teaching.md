Syllabi and other information on my teaching
===

My objectives as an educator of social science, data science, and methods courses, in particular, are to expose students to empirical research through data collection (e.g., survey research or sensors) and data analysis (e.g., linear models and descriptive statistics) and to provide ample opportunity for data presentation and interpretation. Students learn methods and statistics best through examples and hands-on experience, including written reports, problem sets, and presentations.

My teaching focuses on data science, demography, social network methods, and homelessness-related issues. I have also taught courses in statistics and sociology at the graduate and undergraduate levels.

Below is a list of courses I have taught and other teaching-related activities.
